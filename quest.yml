description: >-
  Welcome to your fast-track quest for integrating Segment into a real-world
  React project! Guided by Lucca, your friendly senior engineer, you'll learn
  how to set up Segment's JavaScript SDK in the Anythink Market frontend, send
  your first test event, and confirm everything works using Segment's live
  Debugger.


  You'll start by understanding why customer data platforms like Segment matter, then dive into hands-on coding: adding the Segment snippet, sending a custom event, and verifying your integration. Along the way, you'll pick up best practices for environment separation and event validation. By the end, you'll have a working Segment integration and the confidence to instrument analytics in any web project.


  This quest is perfect for developers new to analytics or Segment, and anyone looking to quickly add event tracking to a modern frontend app.
